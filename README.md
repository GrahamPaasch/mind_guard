# MindGuard: A Patient Engagement Tool for Psychosis

Psychosis is a state of mind where an individual experiences a loss of contact with reality, often manifesting as hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking. This state of mind can lead an individual to take actions that are out of character, potentially unsafe, or harmful to themselves or others.

Therefore, there is a need to keep an individual experiencing psychosis occupied, engaged, and interested in something benign, such as a video game or a chatbot, to prevent them from going out into the world and potentially putting themselves or others at risk. MindGuard is a patient engagement tool that aims to provide safe and engaging alternatives to potentially harmful psychotic behaviors.
